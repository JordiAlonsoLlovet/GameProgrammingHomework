* Instructions *
- The Engine will load the model BakerHouse.gltf by default. You can change it by either selecting one of the available options in the Configuration window or by simply draging a .gltf file into the main Engine Window.
- You can move the camera with WASD, an use the mouse wheel to move forward and backwards with more acuracy. Q and E will move the camera up and down.
- You can change the direction of the camera with the ARROW keys or simply moving the mouse while left clicking.
** Configuration **
- From the Configuration window you can change the current loaded model, rotate the model or change the model's scale. 
- By default all models will be scaled to roughly fit into a 10x10x10 box. This can be disabled by unchecking the AutoScale Checkbox.
- You can also adjust the camera's movement speed, FOV, and the maximum FPS allowed.
** Logs **
- The Logs window displays all of the Engine's output information.
- The button Clear will delete all Logs.
- Logs are also saved into a text file called logs.txt
